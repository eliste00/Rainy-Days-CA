        <h2>ABOUT RAINS</h2>
        <p>Rains was created in 2011 in Denmark and has brought his particular point of view to the classic rainwear. With its cosmopolitan style rainwear Rains offers great comfort, because rain is not an impediment to experience new adventures.
            All of our products are manufactured in factories with more than 15 years of experience with rainwear and quality performance garments. The factories live up to our high standards, which amongst other elements secure health insurance, proper working schedules and clean environments to all persons involved in the production process. These are elements that make the RAINS factories highly attractive for rainwear specialists.
            All components of our products reach the standards of REACH (European chemical standards) and carry the EcoTex 100 certificate to ensure environmental responsibility. Together with international testing centers, we continually test the components of our products to ensure the highest standards and control of both components and quality.</p>
